# ThirdProject
This is a Maven build tool project that demontrates the text fixturesof the object equality, object identity, failing test, timeouts and disabling test.
It also uses a multi-module TDD that shows that the modules work together to deliver the functionality of the application. This is therefore a test driven development.
